This repository contains a collection of my solutions for [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/0de71dbe00f5c7aa768a4079ebb419738960161) puzzles. Mainly for my own archive but feel free to look through those solutions.

Just one thing: **Don't just copy them.** Take the puzzle yourself and afterwards you are able to see my solutions inside CodinGame in the "Solutions" tab of each puzzle. Sure you could copy them as all solutions in "finished" are 100% solutions but that would just be cheating and you will learn nothing from it so just don't do it!
